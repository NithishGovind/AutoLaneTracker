Real-time yellow lane detection and steering control for autonomous race cars using computer vision.


# Yellow Lane Detection and Steering Control for Autonomous Car

This project sets up a camera feed and processes the frames to detect yellow lanes. It adjusts the car's steering based on the detected lane's position. The project uses OpenCV for image processing, JetCam for handling the camera feed, and JetRacer for controlling the car.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- JetCam
